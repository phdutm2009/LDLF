# LDLF
Discovering overlapping communities using a new diffusion approach based on core expanding and Local depth traveling in social networks

This is the Python implementation of LDLF: Discovering overlapping communities using a new diffusion approach based on core expanding and Local depth traveling in social networks.

The original paper is submitted to Scietific report journal: https://researcher.nature.com/

We have used Adjancy list structure as the input file for algorithm. The execution of the LDLF is so simple.
